# [PATCH 1/2] ublk: publish a new device by its id only once it is set up

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261105-ublk-del-gendisk-hang-v1-1-913a91a4314d@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261105-ublk-del-gendisk-hang-v1-1-913a91a4314d@gmail.com/)

```
From: Mark Korenberg <socketpair@gmail.com>

ADD_DEV stores the device in ublk_index_idr when it allocates the id,
and control commands find it there as soon as ublk_add_chdev() has
initialized its struct device, before the char device is added. If
dev_set_name() or cdev_device_add() then fails, ublk_add_chdev() drops
the initial reference to free the device. A DEL_DEV that found the
device meanwhile waits for ublk_ctl_mutex, then calls ublk_remove():
cdev_device_del() of a device that was never added, and a second put of
the initial reference, which frees the device under the callers still
holding references.

Reserve the id with a NULL entry, which idr_find() and the idr iterators
skip, and store the device once ublk_add_chdev() succeeded.

Fixes: 71f28f3136af ("ublk_drv: add io_uring based userspace block driver")
