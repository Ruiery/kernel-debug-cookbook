# [PATCH RFC v2 39/42] usb: gadget: f_mass_storage: refuse files on pseudo filesystems

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261114-work-loop-pseudo-v2-39-98639a2286fb@kernel.org/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261114-work-loop-pseudo-v2-39-98639a2286fb@kernel.org/)

```
fsg_lun_open() takes any regular file as the backing file of a LUN. The
file-storage kthread then reads and writes it with kernel_read() and
kernel_write() on behalf of the USB host. With a procfs or sysfs file
behind a LUN the host gets to read and write kernel interfaces with
kernel credentials. Refuse files on pseudo filesystems just like loop
does by switching to file_check_backing().

The helper also does the file type and readability checks. So the
messages for an unsuitable backing file become one. It looks at the
inode of the file instead of the host of ->f_mapping. For regular files
and block devices both have the same type. It also wants ->read_iter()
where FMODE_CAN_READ was enough so far. But kernel_read() never worked
without ->read_iter() anyway.
