# [PATCH v6 2/9] block: take i_rwsem for the direct I/O write fallback

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-2-307939c387df@columbia.edu/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-2-307939c387df@columbia.edu/)

```
Commit c0e473a0d226 ("block: fix race between set_blocksize and read
paths") closed a race between set_blocksize() and block device I/O: with
large sector size support, set_blocksize() can change i_blkbits and the
mapping's minimum folio order while a concurrent reader still holds a
folio of the old, smaller order, leading to crashes. In particular, it
made blkdev_write_iter() wrap buffered writes in inode_lock_shared().

However, the direct I/O fallback path was missed in that conversion.
blkdev_write_iter() passes blkdev_buffered_write() as an argument to
direct_write_fallback() with no lock held. A direct write that completes
only partially then finishes as a buffered write with no protection.

This can cause a BUG by racing partial direct writes against
ioctl(BLKBSZSET). Writer threads issue O_DIRECT pwritev() with a
two-segment iovec whose second segment is an unreadable PROT_NONE
mapping. The direct path then writes the first segment, fails to pin the
second, and returns short, entering the fallback. A second thread keeps
toggling the second segment's protection so that some fallbacks get past
fault_in_iov_iter_readable() and reach the page cache, a third thread
populates the page cache with folios of the current block size via
pread() and readahead(), and a fourth thread toggles the block size
between 512 bytes and 64K with BLKBSZSET. The minimum folio order only
moves with block sizes above PAGE_SIZE, i.e. with
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE raising BLK_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to 64K.

On a CONFIG_DEBUG_VM kernel this yields the following BUG:

  page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_order(folio) < mapping_min_folio_order(mapping))
  kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:858!

   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f

The same workload also trips WARN_ON_ONCE(pos >= folio_pos(folio) +
fsize) in iomap_trim_folio_range().

Fix this by calling blkdev_buffered_write() in the fallback path under
inode_lock_shared(), matching the plain buffered-write branch. With the
fix the same workload runs clean.

A short IOCB_NOWAIT direct write reaches the same fallback. Taking
i_rwsem there can now block behind set_blocksize(), and the fallback
already blocks on writeback of the data it copied in
direct_write_fallback(). blkdev_write_iter() already rejects a purely
buffered IOCB_NOWAIT write with -EOPNOTSUPP, so do not enter the
fallback for IOCB_NOWAIT at all: return the bytes the direct path
already wrote, or -EAGAIN if none, and let the caller retry.

The reproducer used was written by an LLM, and is available at [1].
