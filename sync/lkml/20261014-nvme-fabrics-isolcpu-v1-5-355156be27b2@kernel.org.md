# [PATCH 5/5] nvme-fabrics: clear the poll map if no poll queues are mapped

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261014-nvme-fabrics-isolcpu-v1-5-355156be27b2@kernel.org/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261014-nvme-fabrics-isolcpu-v1-5-355156be27b2@kernel.org/)

```
From: Daniel Wagner <wagi@kernel.org>

blk_mq_alloc_tag_set sets the nr_queues of every map to nr_hw_queues.
When nr_poll_queues is set but no queues are left for polling,
nvmf_map_queues skips the poll map and leaves it this way, with all CPUs
mapped to hctx 0.  The queue then claims poll support, polled I/O ends
up on hctx 0, which isn't a poll queue, and hctx 0 is marked as a poll
hctx, so even the Connect command of the first I/O queue is marked as
polled.

Clear the poll map when no poll queues are mapped, so polled I/O is
rejected with -EOPNOTSUPP.

Fixes: 1a9460cef571 ("nvme-tcp: support simple polling")
Fixes: 5651cd3c4336 ("nvme-rdma: fix queue mapping when queue count is limited")
