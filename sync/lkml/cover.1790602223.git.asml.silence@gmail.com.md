# [PATCH v7 00/13] Add dmabuf read/write via io_uring

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/cover.1790602223.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/cover.1790602223.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/)

```
The patch set allows to register a dmabuf to an io_uring instance for
a specified file and use it with io_uring read / write requests. The
infrastructure is not tied to io_uring and there could be more users
in the future. A similar idea was attempted some years ago by Keith [1],
from where I borrowed a number of changes. Later it was brough back up
to life by Tushar and Vishal.

It's an opt-in feature for files, and they need to implement a new
file operation to use it. Only NVMe block devices are supported in this
series. The user API is built on top of io_uring's "registered buffers",
where a dmabuf is registered in a special way, but after it can be used
as any other "registered buffer" with IORING_OP_{READ,WRITE}_FIXED
requests. It's created via a new file operation and the resulted map is
then passed through the I/O stack in a new iterator type. There is some
additional infrastructure to glue it together, count requests, manage
lifetime and implement invalidation.

Tushar, William, Phil did a lot of testing and experimentation on various
devices with previous versions of the patch set, and I've received lots
of help from Anuj, Kanchan and Nitesh with investigations, testing, and
patching. Earlier benchmarks by Anuj for IOMMU optimisations with udmabuf
showed:

STRICT: before = 570 KIOPS, after = 5.01 MIOPS
LAZY: before = 1.93 MIOPS, after = 5.01 MIOPS
PASSTHROUGH: before = 5.01 MIOPS, after = 5.01 MIOPS

# Patch set structure:
- Patches 1-2 introduce internal API and infrastructure mediating
  io_uring and target subsystem / devices
- Patches 3-5: block layer support + prep patches
- Patches 6-8 implement NVMe support
- Patches 9-13 add io_uring support and uapi.

There are some liburing tests that can serve as an example:
git: https://github.com/isilence/liburing.git rw-dmabuf-tests-v5
url: https://github.com/isilence/liburing/tree/rw-dmabuf-tests-v5

The patches are based on Jens' for-next. Also available as a branch:
git: https://github.com/isilence/linux.git rw-dmabuf-v7

v7: - refcount *_io_ctx 
    - wait rcu grace period for ctx->map before freeing maps
    - increment map counters under dma resv lock
    - more comments about bio splitting
    - make ->unmap responsible for freeing maps to match ->map
    - replace dma_sync_single* with full table sync
    - detach dma-buf on nvme reset after cancel nvme_cancel_tagset

v6: - remove fences and wait on invalidation synchronously
    - report all map requests are detached earlier, outside of wq
    - handle nvme removal
    - gate nvme_free_descriptors() on iod->nr_descriptors 
    - fix error handling in nvme_rq_setup_dmabuf_map() 
    - fix iov_iter_alignment()
    - relax the 1G io_uring registered dma-buf limit
    - fix type overflow issue in bio split
    - allocate struct dma_buf_io_ctx inside the dma-buf-io code
    - harden block checks against dma-buf + buffered io

v5: - Reject dma-buf with buffered IO for raw bdev
    - Add lim->max_segments bio splitting
    - Add bio_iov_iter_set() helper
    - Fix io_uring uapi validation
    - Other minor changes
    NVMe:
    - Rename nvme_pci_sgl_set_data() to nvme_pci_dma_iter_set_sgl(), split 
      into its own prep patch.
    - Convert segment walk loops to do-while.
    - Drop adjacent segment coalescing logic.
    - Drop first_dma/first_len from nvme_pci_dmabuf_sgl_nents()
    - Remove entries > NVME_MAX_SEGS bailout; moving to the block layer.
    - Factor SGL vs PRP decision making into a helper.

v4: - https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1785274111.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/
    - Add sgl support from Anuj
    - Move it under drivers/dma-buf/ and rename
    - Fix mis-sized allocations
    - Fix io_uring re-import mishandling
    - Drop map before io_uring "task work"
    - Move blk-mq callback to block_device_operations
    - Convert bio flag to REQ_OP*
    - Other small changes

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/cover.1777475843.git.asml.silence@gmail.com/
    - Rework io_uring registration
    - Move token/map infrastructure code out of blk-mq
    - Simplify callbacks: remove a separate blk-mq table, which was
      mostly just forwarding calls (to nvme).
    - Don't skip dma sync depending on request direction
    - Fix a couple of hangs
    - Rename s/dma/dmabuf/
    - Other small changes

v2: - Don't pass raw dma addresses, wrap it into a driver specific object
    - Split into two objects: token and map
    - Implement move_notify
