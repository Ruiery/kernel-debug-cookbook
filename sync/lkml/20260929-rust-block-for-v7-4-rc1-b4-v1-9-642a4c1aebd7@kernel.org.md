# [PATCH GIT PULL 9/9] rust: block: require `Sync` for `Operations::QueueData`

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20260929-rust-block-for-v7-4-rc1-b4-v1-9-642a4c1aebd7@kernel.org/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20260929-rust-block-for-v7-4-rc1-b4-v1-9-642a4c1aebd7@kernel.org/)

```
The queue data installed in a `GenDisk` is stored in the request queue and
handed back to the driver as a shared borrow through the `queue_rq` and
`commit_rqs` callbacks. Both callbacks obtain that borrow via
`ForeignOwnable::borrow` and may execute concurrently on several CPUs,
since the block layer runs one hardware queue per CPU. That means a shared
reference to the same queue data can be live on multiple threads at once,
which is only sound when the referent is `Sync`.

The initial `GenDisk` private data support omitted this bound, so a
driver could install a non-`Sync` type as queue data and then access
it concurrently from multiple CPUs without synchronization. Add a
`Sync` bound to the `QueueData` associated type to rule that out.

Fixes: 90d952fac8ac ("rust: block: add `GenDisk` private data support")
