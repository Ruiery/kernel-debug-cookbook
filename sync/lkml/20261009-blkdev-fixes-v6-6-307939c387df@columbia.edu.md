# [PATCH v6 6/9] block: don't fall back to buffered I/O for atomic writes

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-6-307939c387df@columbia.edu/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-6-307939c387df@columbia.edu/)

```
blkdev_direct_write() turns an -EBUSY from page cache invalidation into
a 0 return, so an IOCB_ATOMIC write is retried in full through
blkdev_buffered_write(), with no atomicity guarantee.

Skip the buffered fallback in blkdev_write_iter() for IOCB_ATOMIC, as
it already does for IOCB_NOWAIT, so the -EBUSY case returns -EAGAIN and
the caller retries, matching __iomap_dio_rw().

ext4 has the same fallback and only warns in it. For block devices the
fallback can be skipped before any I/O is submitted, so fail early
instead.
