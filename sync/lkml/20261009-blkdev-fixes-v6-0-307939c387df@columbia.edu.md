# [PATCH v6 0/9] block device fixes for large block sizes, IOCB_NOWAIT, and direct I/O

来源：[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-0-307939c387df@columbia.edu/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20261009-blkdev-fixes-v6-0-307939c387df@columbia.edu/)

```
A set of independent fixes for the block device file operations. The
first two were found by Sashiko while reviewing the RWF_DONTCACHE series
[1]. The fourth and fifth were found by Sashiko's review of v1 of this
series, and the rest came from asking an LLM to find any similar or
related issues. Each issue has been reproduced, with the fixes resolving
the issues.

Patch 1 fixes silently lost mmap writes with CONFIG_BUFFER_HEAD=n.

Patches 2 and 3 take i_rwsem around the direct I/O write fallback and
the splice read path, which race set_blocksize() changing the mapping's
minimum folio order.

Patch 4 makes the buffered read path honor IOCB_NOWAIT instead of
blocking on i_rwsem.

Patch 5 makes IOCB_ATOMIC writes fail instead of tearing, and patch 6
stops the buffered fallback from retrying an atomic write. Block
devices can reject both paths into the fallback before submitting any
I/O, so we fail rather than issue a WARN() like ext4 does. Patch 7
makes iomap_file_buffered_write() reject IOCB_ATOMIC, so no other
buffered fallback can complete an atomic write either.

Patch 8 fixes leaked page pins in bio_iov_iter_align_down(), and patch
9 removes dead metadata handling in the async direct I/O path.

These issues are currently unlikely to be hit in practice due to the
specific configurations required to trigger them.

The reproducer for patch 1 is in blktests as block/048, and tests for
patches 2, 3 and 8 are posted at [2].
